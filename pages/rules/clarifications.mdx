<Heading>5e Rule Clarifications</Heading>

Where the rules of 5th edition are unclear or run counter to the way we play the game, additional clarifications are sometimes necessary to keep Travellers Guild games running smoothly. These rule clarifications held here may be overridden by DMs at their leisure, but serve as a baseline to help to provide a consistent experience across Travellers Guild games. 

While these rulings can be overruled by a DM, we strongly advise against expecting a DM to do so, and recommend avoiding builds that rely on specific (and/or strange) interpretations of the rules.

Clarifications fall under the following categories:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 mt-10 mb-10 gap-10">
