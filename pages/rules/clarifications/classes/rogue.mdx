<h2>General</h2>
- Hiding requires something to hide in/behind. Always describe to the DM what you are using to conceal your presence. "I stealth" is not an action, this isn't Skyrim.

<h2>Specific Archetypes</h2>
- The Thief archetype's "Fast Hands" ability allows you to take an additional **Interact with an Object** action as a bonus action (normally, you get one of these per turn, Thieves get 2). 
  - Mundane, non-magical items that would otherwise require an action to activate are a valid choice for this ability (such as Alchemist's Fire, Ball Bearings, and Healer's Kits), but magical items (such as scrolls, potions, and wonderous items) are not valid choices. This is due to a rule specified in the Dungeon Master's Guide (p. 141):
        > If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an Object action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item"
