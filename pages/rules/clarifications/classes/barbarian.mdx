<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 
    **Rage** specifies _"a melee weapon attack using Strength"_ - This means that you **can** use weapons that have the Finesse property, but you must use your Strength for the attack, and not your Dexterity. This also means that the attack must be specifically a melee attack, and not those made by ranged or throwing weapons.
</li>
  <li> 
    The additional damage dealt while raging is the same damage type as your weapon's primary damage type - typically slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing. If your weapon deals an exotic type of damage _**instead**_ of the regular weapon damage (such as Radiant while using a Sunblade), the damage from your rage will match that instead.
</li>
  <li> 
    The **Unarmored Defense** ability _sets_ your base armour class to a fixed value. This means it does not stack with armour you are wearing, or any other effects that set your armour class (such as Barkskin or Mage Armour). Any effects that _add_ to your AC, such as a Ring of Protection, will still add to your AC.
</li>
  <li> 
    You may not maintain concentration while raging. This is purely a reminder, as it is stated in the rage ability, which you should read **thoroughly** (it's your most crucial class ability).
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Specific Archetypes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
**Path of the Zealot** Barbarians can be resurrected for free between adventures if their body is recoverable. If not, a Wish is still required for 4 renown.
</li>
