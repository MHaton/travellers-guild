<h2>General</h2>
- While Druids typically avoid wearing or using metal equipment in Forgotten Realms lore, Travellers Guild games span many planes and realities with different customs and beliefs. Whether your Druid adheres to similar beliefs is up to you. If you receive a magic item made of metal or some other objectionable material, you may choose to reflavour the item (in-universe, it has been customised for free by Guild artisans. You're welcome.)

<h2>Wild Shape</h2>
- Wild shape may be used to transform into any beast you have seen. The Traveller's Guild has access to every officially printed beast for new druids to observe at their leisure, but you may wish to keep track for yourself (see _Xanathar's Guide_ for ideas of which beasts you may have seen).
- Owlbears are considered beasts for the purposes of Wild Shape, because the movie is great and owlbears are cool. No other reason.
- Attacks made while wild shaped are not considered unarmed attacks for the purposes of features such as Monk class features.
    - However, all creatures are capable of making unarmed attacks, even if the attack is not listed in their statblock. When making an unarmed attack, you deal 1+your strength modifier, and any other features that affect your unarmed attacks apply (such as monk martial arts).
- While wild shaped, you maintain the benefits of your class features, provided your chosen form is capable of them. This includes (but is not limited to):
  - Rogue **Uncanny Dodge**
  - Monk **Flurry of Blows**
  - **Extra Attack** (see below)
- Using a creature's natural weapons counts as taking the attack action with a weapon.
  - Yes, this does mean that you can use **Divine Smite**. You're welcome.
- When a form has the **Multiattack** action, this does _not_ count as taking the Attack Action for the purposes of features such as Extra Attack.
- You cannot cast spells while wildshaped, which includes psionics in 5e as they let you "cast" certain spells.
- While in Wild Shape, you keep your own proficiency bonus, unless the beast's is naturally higher (unlikely, but possible).
- While in wild shape, you generally maintain access to your skill proficiencies, but whether you can make full use of them is up to the DM (bear paws are not built for lockpicking).
- While in wild shape, you may make use of effects such as unarmored defense, but you must calculate your armour class accordingly - the natural armour of the beast does not apply, just like if you were to wear armour in your humanoid form.
- While wild shaped, you remain able to understand all languages you otherwise understood, and you do not gain or lose access to any languages or methods of communication.
  -  This means that unless you cast Speak With Animals, you cannot talk to other animals, even if you are the same type of animal as them. At the DM's discretion, they may allow you to attempt to communicate through body language, but you do not innately gain the ability to speak Bear.
  - This also means that unless the druid themselves speak the language, turning into a creature that knows a language such as a fire elemental does not grant them knowledge of Ignan, or the ability to speak and understand it. As elementals are capable of speech, they would instead be able to communicate in Common.
