<h2>General</h2>
- If a fallen enemy spellcaster was a Wizard with a spellbook, you may loot the spellbook from that enemy as a common magic item (i.e. one that does not count against the maximum adventure rewards or renown). The spells within must be scribed into your own spellbook per the standard rules for copying a spell as you would a spell scroll. The DM should be able to provide a list of the spells found within.
  - If they cannot, then the book was destroyed during combat along with its owner, and may not be recovered.
- You may only choose a maximum number of spells equal to 2+your current tier to recover from a fallen enemy's spellbook.
- Cantrips may not be transcribed from spell scrolls or looted spell books
- Spells traded between Wizard spell books must be a 1:1 trade for spells of the same combined spell level (for example, 5 level 1 spells for a level 5 spell).
- If your spellbook is ever completely destroyed during a session, you may recover it for a single point of Renown.

<h2>Specific Archetypes</h2>
- **Minor Conjuration** (from the **School of Conjuration**) cannot be used to create a consumable item such as poisons, alchemist's fire, acid vials, or potions of any type.
